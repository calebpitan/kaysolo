# KayBot Application

KayBot is a chatbot that can be utilized for lead generation in the field of digital marketing.
We make use of OpenAI's ability to understand natural language and generate content based on a provided prompt.

## How to run

Set essential environment variables. The first step to running the application is setting the environment variables required for the application to run.
You can create these `.env` files from the `.env.template` files or you could just use them as a guide to know what variables need to be provided.

Note: The JWT asymmetric keys are auto-generated and there's a Python script provided to generate them.

- There are a couple of `.env` files that need to be created from the `.env.template` files.
- There's a `.env` file required at the project root. These are essential for running the compose file, while some are passed by the compose file to individual applications.
- There's also a `.env` file required at the `./kaybot-services` root. You may ignore the ones that are annotated with "`# SET IN docker-compose.yml`" when running locally.

After providing the values for these variables in their respective `.env` files you may go ahead to generate the JWT asymmetric signing key pairs:

```sh
cd ./kaybot-services

chmod +x ./export_keys.py # once through the lifetime of the file

./export_keys.py
```

or simply:

```batch
cd ./kaybot-services

python3 ./export_keys.py
```

When all these are done, you can go ahead to start the application in one of the following ways:

- Using the `make` command, since the project contains a `Makefile` at the project root
- Using `docker` directly from the command line

Note: Windows users, most likely, won't have the `make` command on their system. While the app can be started using the `docker` command directly,
you may also need to have Docker installed.

Using make:

```sh
make up_build
```

Using docker:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```
